<h1 id="12-companies-hiring-fortran-engineers">12 Companies hiring FORTRAN Engineers</h1>
<p>Not dead yet! IBM&#39;s 1950s <em>Formula Translator</em> (FORTRAN) sits in 30th position on the TIOBE index (<a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">May 2022</a>), and has regained some popularity in the High Performance Computing (HPC) world.</p>
<p>Given its ability to run on 18kb of RAM (at least originally - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM704</a>), the language has held on for decades as a highly performant tool for mathematics and data analysis. Primarily used in research institutions (ex: <a href="https://degenerateconic.com/circular-restricted-three-body-problem.html">Three-Body Problem</a>).</p>
<p>But I wanted to scrape around on the internet and find some non-research companies actively hiring for the Fortran developers. Most of these are pulled from public listings which may include irrelevant languages, so I&#39;ve tried to filter down to companies with explicit Fortran based products.</p>
<p>I found a handfull of companies, typically distributed across these 6 industries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aerospace &amp; Defense</li>
<li>Compilers</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Graphics Cards</li>
<li>High Performance Computing (HPC)</li>
<li>Orbital Mapping (asteroids)</li>
<li>Weather Modeling</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-top-12">The top 12:</h2>
<p>Ranked in order of <em>Most needing Fortran</em> to <em>Least needing Fortran</em></p>
<h3 id="1-hewlett-packard-compiler--hpc">1. Hewlett Packard (Compiler &amp; HPC)</h3>
<p>HP maintains the Cray Compilation Environment (<a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=a00115296en_us&amp;page=OpenMP_Overview.html">CCE</a>), so it makes sense they would have a need for Fortran developers. This position mentions updating standards to support Fortran 2023 (<a href="https://wg5-fortran.org/N2151-N2200/N2194.pdf">F202X</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site</strong>: <a href="https://www.hp.com/">https://www.hp.com/</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-nvidia-graphics-cards">2. NVIDIA (Graphics Cards)</h3>
<p>Not surprising since Nvidia has <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-fortran">CUDA FORTRAN</a>, a Fortran analog to their CUDA C compiler. CUDA Fortran is a lower-level explicit programming model that allows direct control of GPGPU programming.</p>

<h3 id="4-general-atomics-energy---hpc">4. General Atomics (Energy - HPC)</h3>
<p>General Atomics is an Energy and Defense conglomerate. This position is likely under their nuclear fission / fusion group, working on plasma simulations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#:~:text=Magnetohydrodynamics%20(MHD%3B%20also%20called%20magneto,%2C%20salt%20water%2C%20and%20electrolytes)">MHD</a> and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).</p>

<li><strong>Description</strong>: <em>This position optimizes, benchmarks and tests existing HPC software, including MHD plasma and CFD simulators.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-raytheon-technologies-aerospace---hpc">5. Raytheon Technologies (Aerospace - HPC)</h3>
<p>Another HPC application, this time for the simulation and testing of jet engine design. Under the Pratt &amp; Whitney division, the Survivability Engineering team is developing software tools for simulations and data management regarding infrared and radar electromagnetic evaluation of systems.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="6-tomorrowio-weather">6. Tomorrow.io (Weather)</h3>
<p>Weather and climate forecasting is a notoriously complicated space. There&#39;s a massive ecosystem of Fortran tools for weather modeling stretching back to the 1980s, and it&#39;s often not worth reinventing the wheel (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268870715_Climate_Models_Challenges_for_Fortran_Development_Tools">Climate Models: Challenges for Fortran Development Tools</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We are going to mine near-earth asteroids to provide abundant, sustainable water and mineral resources for the space economy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems that Karman+ literally plans for asteroid mining, starting with retrieval &amp; recovery of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). I imagine this is similar to the Jacobs <em>&quot;MMOD&quot;</em> position. Keeping track of a large number of orbiting bodies.</p>

<h3 id="10-amazon-cloud--hpc-needs-verification">10. Amazon (Cloud / HPC) [<em>Needs Verification</em>]</h3>
<p>Same as the Apple case. Listed as a requirement, but I&#39;m unable to find active AWS development in Fortran. I have no doubt that some Fortran code exists somewhere on the AWS HPC team, but hard to say whether it is a priority.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="11-apple-computers--hpc-needs-verification">11. Apple (Computers / HPC) [<em>Needs Verification</em>]</h3>
<p>It&#39;s unclear if there is a direct Fortran position at Apple or if the HR team is just a little overzealous in their requirements. I wasn&#39;t able to spot any public facing Fortran tools for Mac, but it&#39;s possibly used in their HPC team.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="-ge-power-energy">??. GE Power (Energy)</h3>
<p>Including this one only for the laughs. Perhaps there is a WASM port for Fortran... but I wouldn&#39;t typically categorize it under &quot;front-end-technologies&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site</strong>: <a href="https://www.ge.com/">https://www.ge.com/</a></li>
<li><strong>Position</strong>: <a href="https://jobs.gecareers.com/power/global/en/job/GE11GLOBALR3643308EXTERNALENGLOBAL/Staff-Software-Engineer-Remote?utm_source=linkedin&amp;codes=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=phenom-feeds">Staff Software Engineer</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>
<p>Still working on verifying a few names in this list, and I&#39;ll keep it updated as I receive feedback.</p>
<p>Sent out quite a few of these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey ${name}, I&#39;m writing up a &quot;10+ companies hiring for Fortran&quot; kind of blog. I see it as a requirement for ${company} positions. Just wanted to verify that it was for real, and not just overzealous job requirements.</p>

<p>Also feel free to shoot me an email (<a href="mailto:&#x74;&#x79;&#x6c;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#x72;&#121;&#115;&#x6f;&#108;&#x76;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x74;&#x79;&#x6c;&#101;&#114;&#64;&#x72;&#121;&#115;&#x6f;&#108;&#x76;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>) if you&#39;re actively developing in Fortran and you think your company should be on the list.</p>
