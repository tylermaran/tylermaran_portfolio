	<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>I come up with ideas all the time. Way more than I could ever pursue. Rather than lock them in a shoebox to be forgotten, I think I&#39;ll put them out on the internet. All concepts are fair game. If you find something you like, then try to make it a reality!</p>
<p>If you want to chat about any ideas, drop me a line <a href='https://twitter.com/TylerMaran' target='_blank'>@tylermaran</a></p>
<h2 id="mr-roboto---a-robot-that-makes-raman-for-you">Mr. Roboto - A robot that makes raman for you</h2>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m imagining a roadside raman stand. 6 seats. Humanoid robot (at least the upper half) serving up bowls of Raman 24 hours a day.</li>
<li>Raman should be easier than most of the food robot attempts out there, it&#39;s 90% water after all (cheap raman I mean, not trying to insult the incredible craft of Raman).</li>
<li>Probably not a great business idea. CafeX (and all it&#39;s competitors) failed after all. The world is just not ready for robotic food that isn&#39;t vending maching shaped. But it would be fun to build. And I can imagine showing up at 2 am and chatting with Mr. Roboto while serves me some raman.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authhawk---inserting-env-vars-at-runtime">AuthHawk - Inserting env vars at runtime</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most companies do a terrible job at sharing and managing <code>.env</code> variables. The idea is an <code>npm</code> package that pings a service with the server&#39;s private key, grabs a list of secret keys, and inserts them into the Node <code>process.env</code></li>
<li>This does a couple things<ol>
<li>No more slacking your env variablies back and forth. You just configure your keypair once, and then all the secrets live on a central server.</li>
<li>No more having out of date secrets, it gets pulled every few seconds</li>
<li>Easy to roll keys without impacting your dev team. It will auto pull the new keys when it polls for new keys.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t have to manage a separate set of keys on Heroku, or AWS, or whatever. It&#39;ll still pull from the same source, just with a different Public/Private key pair for production vs. dev secrets.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="izac---robotic-bartender">iZac - robotic bartender</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tylermaran.github.io/izac/" target='_blank'>I actually built this one!</a> And it was glorious. But he eventually fell into disrepair and was uncermoniously turned into spare parts. Always an idea I meant to come back to. Learned a lot from the previous iteration, and have some good ideas for where to go with a future model.</li>
<li>Business potential:<ul>
<li>Self serve is cool and all, but raises a lot of potential problems (over consumption, underage, etc.). The real value is back of the bar. Say you&#39;re at a busy club and a sorority comes in and orders 15 vodka cranberrys - just hit Vodka-Cran x 15 and watch them all pop out.</li>
<li>Music festivals / cruises - anything where people are carrying around that RFID wristband and have been ID&#39;d ahead of time. Solves two of the most annoying problems (id &amp; payments)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pigeon---email-template-tool-with-built-in-sql-queries">Pigeon - Email template tool with built in SQL queries</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pigeon-dev.netlify.app/" target='_blank'>MVP up and running!</a></li>
<li>Idea came up when I had to send a lot of one off emails to users at Rysolv. The flow always went something like:<ol>
<li><code>SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE something = TRUE</code></li>
<li>Copy paste the csv into mailchimp</li>
<li>Template and send the email from mailchimp</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So instead I built an email templating tool that had a built in SQL terminal.</li>
</ul>
