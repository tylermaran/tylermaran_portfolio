All things Tyler

This is a basic portfolio page I designed in reactjs. All of the projects pull from a `projects.json` file located in the ./react_ui folder. [master/react_ui/src/projects.json](https://github.com/tylermaran/tylermaran/blob/master/react_ui/src/projects.json)

*Below is an exaple of the project.json formatting:* 
>"name": "Example Page",

>"url": "https://www.example.com/",

>"git_link": "https://www.github.com/username/example-repo",

>"private": "true",  // will disable the repo link

>"desktop_image": ".png",

>"mobile_image": ".png",

>"show_phone": "true", //whether or not to show the cellphone view

>"detail_image": ".png",

>"description": "Main description under the modal",

>"detail": "Under the hood stuff",

>"additional_link": "extra info here!"

If you would like to copy this page, it should be as simple as cloning the repo and editing the projects.json folder to add your content.

Note: all desktop images are a 16:9 ratio. 

## Running
Clone the repo

Run `npm i` in the top level and the ./react_ui folder

`npm run dev` within ./react_ui to start the dev server

`npm run build` within ./react_ui to start a production build. Note this build stage finishes with moving the build folder into the parent directory.

Post build: run `npm run start` from the parent level to serve the production build.
