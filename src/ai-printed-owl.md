## GPT can 3D Print!

It's clear that LLM can do a whole lot more than search text and write code. Microsoft even demo'd ChatGPT as an <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/autonomous-systems-group-robotics/articles/chatgpt-for-robotics/' target='_blank'>interface for robotics</a>. So how well can it do 3D designs?

## OpenSCAD

<a href='https://openscad.org/' target='_blank'>OpenSCAD</a>.

GPT refuses to just dump an STL file for me, but is more than happy to generate OpenSCAD code. If you haven't used it before, OpenSCAD is a FOSS CAD software designed for people who think that JavaScript is the
optimal tool for creating 3D models.

## The owl

Somewhere in GPT's galaxy brain lies this owl. Rather snowman like, but for GPT it apparently checks all the boxes. Head smaller than the body. Beak centrally located on the head.
