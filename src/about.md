# hello reader

Welcome to Tyler Maran's moderately organized brain dump. Expect this to be a pretty constant work-in-progress. There are 1,000 ideas I'm interested in exploring, and I'm using this medium to put some of them into reality.

## A few topics I'm pretty interested in:

### Building stuff

I like to build stuff. Robots, software, furniture, some rough metalworking. I get paid to do software, but generally interested in anything I can get my hands on.

-   I built a bartending robot that managed to turn a profit ([iZac](https://tylermaran.github.io/izac/))
-   I made the blog generator you're reading now ([msgo](https://github.com/rysolv/markdown_ssg))

### Getting off the planet

Look space is cool. Really cool. And it doesn't seem like there's enough work being done to get people off the planet (and ideally onto a new one).

### Sustainable living?

Not sure if this is the right section title. But I'm generally annoyed at the fragility of modern infrastructure. And I think we could do better.
